## ***User story***
#### As Ifeanyi's boss, I want to see if he can implement a two-player mode, allowing people to play against each other on the same device so that the game can be a social and interactive experience for users.
#### My friend Ifeanyi made this Tic Tac Toe game. He is a sore loser any time we play games together and always quits I want to make sure that there's a restart button so that when I beat him we can restart the game so I can beat him again.
